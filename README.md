Project Overview:
The Text-to-Speech Converter project aims to develop a software application capable of converting written text into natural-sounding human speech. Users will be able to input text, and the system will generate audio output in the form of spoken words. This project can be implemented as a standalone application, a web service, or integrated into existing software.

Project Components:
1-Text Input Interface:
Create a user-friendly interface where users can input or paste the text they want to convert to speech.
2-Text Processing:
Develop algorithms to process the input text. This involves tasks like text normalization, tokenization, and natural language processing (NLP) to improve the quality of speech output.
3-Text-to-Speech Engine:
Implement the core component responsible for generating speech from the processed text. This typically involves using speech synthesis techniques and models.
4-Voice Selection:
Allow users to choose from a selection of voices or accents for the generated speech, if applicable.
5-Audio Output:
Generate audio files or provide real-time audio streaming of the converted speech.

Project Goals:
Develop a reliable and user-friendly Text-to-Speech converter.
Achieve high-quality speech output with natural intonation.
Support multiple languages and accents.
Provide customization options for users.
